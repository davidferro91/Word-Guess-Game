# Word-Guess-Game
## Description
This is a classic hangman-type game, but one that is browser-based using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  The object of the game is to guess the Space-themed words with only 10 incorrect answers (which for some of the words is not too easy).

The bulk of this project is done using JavaScript (but not jQuery), making it a dynamic webpage that reacts primarily to keystrokes, but also includes a button for clicking if someone wanted to reset their scores.

With that, there are many variables and arrays involved (at least the most that I've used up to this point).  It was a good exercise in declaring local versus global variables and using them inside and outside of functions.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask me!  My email is david-ferro@sbcglobal.net.

Enjoy!
